        <h1>Ioannem</h1>
        <h2>John Misael Villanueva</h2>
        <p>
          Ioannem is a typeface based on the 1604 book Ordinationes Generales, printed by Juan de Vera, the
          oldest extant book produced with movable type in the Philippines. The typeface is wide and rounded,
          featuring wedge serifs for an authentic historical feel. I meticulously studied the scanned copy of
          Ordinationes Generales, focusing on the letter proportions and details, and recreated the typeface to
          capture the essence of the original while being suitable for modern use. Ioannem is available in regular
          weight and supports multiple languages.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
          As a teacher turned type designer, John discovered his passion for type at a young age and pursued it
          as a career. He always try to incorporate Filipino culture into his designs, aiming to create typefaces that
          reflect the beauty of the Filipino language and heritage and are accessible to all Filipinos.
