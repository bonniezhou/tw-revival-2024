        <h1>Mermaid Caslon</h1>
        <h2>April Moralba</h2>
        <p>
          Mermaid Caslon is a revival typeface based on the text found in the Hodder and Stoughton’s 1911
          limited run printing of “Stories by Hans Andersen.” The original typeface appears to be set in a version
          of Caslon or a typeface heavily inspired by Caslon based on the features. The choice of source is a
          sentimental attachment to the story “The Mermaid.” My daughter Mayari Rose spent 35 days in the
          Neonatal Intensive Care Unit after she was born. The doctors and nurses recommended we sing or
          read quietly to her while she was in the incubator. Research has also shown better cardiorespiratory
          strength and growth in babies exposed to parents’ voices in the NICU. So, I spent many hours reading
          to her and one of those stories was “The Mermaid.”
