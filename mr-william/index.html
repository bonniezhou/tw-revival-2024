        <h1>Mr. William</h1>
        <h2>Pearl Law</h2>
        <p>
          Mr. William is a revival of a typeface found in Mr. William Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, &
          Tragedies, also known as the First Folio. Printed in 1623 by Isaac Jaggard and Edward Blount in
          London, with the King’s Men providing the manuscript, it had been quite an undertaking as the
          proofreading was done during the printing, resulting in some copies containing different
          typographical errors and letter punches. The general consensus was that the Folio was typeset
          in Haultin, a roman typeface designed by the French punchcutter Pierre Haultin.
          Due to the uneven textures from the source material, some artistic liberties have been taken,
          thus this can also be seen as a contemporary adaptation. This typeface is compact, with short
          cap height and even shorter descenders, perfect for any publication with a need for small text.

          Pearl Law is an illustrator and comic artist based in Hong Kong, who likes to juxtapose hand
          lettering with her illustrations. With a keen interest in exploring the world of typography, she
          joins Type West to expand her visual vocabulary in the written word. When she’s not hunched
          over her desk working or making zines for fun, she can be found going on walks with her dog
          Poppy.
