        <h1>Jasmine de Lune</h1>
        <h2>Bonnie Zhou</h2>
        <p>
          Jasmine de Lune is a type revival of St. George, a typeface published by Stephenson Blake & Co in 1908. It was designed as a high-class letter for
          commercial work, booklets, catalogues, books and more, to be used as either a display or text typeface. St. George is
          very similar to its widely-recognized sister typeface, Windsor, which was also published in the same specimen.
          <br/><br/>
          Jasmine de Lune aims to capture the "sparkly" personality of the typeface — its casual, elegant, but un-sophisticated
          glamour. The name is inspired by the text sample from Aladdin that the original typeface was set in, reminiscent of a cool breeze on a summer night.

          Bonnie Zhou is a Canadian multidisciplinary artist with a background in software engineering. Based in Brooklyn, New
          York, her work incorporates glass, painting, and Chinese calligaphy. Her interest in type design emerged from the
          intersection of her experiences in frontend design systems, neon lettering, and calligraphy.
