            Paige is a revival of Vale Type, a roman style typeface originally designed by Charles Ricketts, 
            a typographer, publisher, and wood engraver in 1896. This revival is based off the source material “Of Gardens,” 
            written by Francis Bacon and designed by Lucien Pissarro. Known for his artistic and thoughtful approach to 
            typography, Ricketts played a significant role in the Arts and Crafts movement. His work was known for its 
            craftsmanship, classical influences, and attention to detail. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This revival takes inspiration from Ricketts’ artistic practice and honors the charm and unique 
            characteristics of the original character set, while incorporating subtle additions to enhance the 
            reading experience and readability.
