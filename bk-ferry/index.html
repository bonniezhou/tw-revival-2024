            It didn’t take me long to decide that Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” would be the source material 
            for my revival typeface. I knew I wanted something I could connect with, close to my heart and — 
            as is the case with Whitman's celebrated volume — close to my home. “Leaves of Grass” was published 
            in Brooklyn during a pivotal era in queer history. In fact, the first edition was printed just blocks 
            away from my neighborhood, at the Rome Brothers print shop in Brooklyn Heights in 1855. We know from the 
            text itself that Whitman frequented this area, and the docks around the Fulton Street ferry in particular, 
            in the years leading up to the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. Within the earliest editions of the 
            book lives a clandestine homoeroticism that provides a beautifully unique and honest perspective on this 
            moment in Brooklyn history.

            Importantly, Whitman himself set many of the pages by hand, and drew a beautifully embellished version of 
            the body type for the cover. The printing is inky and inconsistent, lending a unique character to this edition. 
            I decided to embrace some of this imperfect quality in my revival, making for a fun and challenging project.
