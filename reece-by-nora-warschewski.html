            The Albatross was a publishing house based in Hamburg/Paris,
            producing the first modern mass-market paperback books to be sold in
            continental Europe. Albatross stressed contemporary writing and
            design. Their competitor Tauchnitz was eventually put up for sale
            but couldn’t be acquired by Albatross due to Albatross’ Jewish ties
            in the ownership, management, and distribution. The political
            context was a significant factor in the interlocking histories of
            both companies. Even with the rise of the Nazis, Albatross continued
            to publish Jewish and banned authors but the team was eventually
            split apart by restrictions on Jewish ownership of property and the
            increasing threats. Albatross’ books were produced in great
            quantities and are not necessarily rare today, but many disappeared
            without trace. Just like Jewish life in Germany today.

            Albatross used Baskerville cuts by the Monotype Corporation (1932) for a few books published in the 
            Modern Continental Library.
