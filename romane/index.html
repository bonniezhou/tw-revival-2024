        <h1>Romane</h1>
        <h2>Talya Baker</h2>
        <p>
          Romane is inspired by an educational booklet published in the nascent Republic of Turkey in 1928. The
          aim of the brochure was to teach the Turkish public their own language, but using a Latin alphabet for
          the first time. Thie pages had just 3 months to reform a nation’s understanding of a language model –
          from Arabic and Osmanic script to a romanisation that was to mark an era of reform and modernisation.
          <br/><br/>
          The focus of this revival featured within this booklet is from the Romana family. It is most likely from
          Italy’s Nebiolo foundry, due to its similarities to Raffaelo and Romana Antico Serie 101. It’s an Elzeviran
          serif, popularised in the 1920s and 1930s, but with roots as early as the start of the 19th Century.
