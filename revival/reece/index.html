            The Albatross was a publishing house based in Hamburg/Paris, producing the first modern mass-market 
            paperback books to be sold in continental Europe. Albatross stressed contemporary writing, design, 
            and typography and their books were designed by Giovanni Mardersteig (Officina Bodoni). The political context was a 
            significant factor in the interlocking histories of Albatross and their competitor Tauchnitz who was 
            eventually put up for sale but couldn’t be acquired due to Albatross’ Jewish ties. Even with the rise of 
            the Nazis, Albatross continued to publish Jewish and potentially controversial English language titles. 
            The Albatross team was eventually split apart by restrictions on Jewish ownership of property and the 
            increasing threats. Albatross’ books were produced in significant quantities and are not necessarily rare 
            today, but many disappeared without a trace. Just like Jewish life in Germany today.

            Albatross used, among other typefaces, Baskerville cuts by the Monotype Corporation for a few books published in the Modern Continental Library.
