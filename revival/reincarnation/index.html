            The original typeface is called Von Speyer’s Roman, produced in 1470s by Johann & Wendelin von Speyer, 
            (d. 1470 & 1477). During my search for a typeface to revive, I found these beautiful letters lying on the 
            pages of De civitate Dei (The City of God) by Arelius Agustinne. Following my deeper research, there are 
            not any other versions of the typeface found. De civitate Dei by Arelius Augustinne is the only document 
            recorded to be printed using Von Speyer’s Roman. The typeface shows exception in legibility due to the 
            proportion of the letters & the spacing. Furthermore, the wide, clear capitals are proven to demonstrate 
            wonderful display quality. The combination of the lowercase & uppercase turns the typeface into a master 
            piece, both in small & big scale. However, since the print is extremely unclear & inconsistent, only the 
            features & type proportions were kept strictly. Some of the details were altered to fit the new intention 
            for the typeface.
