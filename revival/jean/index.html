            Jean is a revival typeface based on Jean Jannon’s type. Jean Jannon is considered one of the main 
            representatives of French typography in the first half of the 17th century and the first of the great 
            typographic artists of the European Baroque. Jannon’s typefaces were based on Claude Garamond’s design. 
            Although both present some similarities, the Jannon type presents baroque forms that are more asymmetrical 
            and with a more irregular axis and inclination.
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose this typeface because of the elegance of the letterform and the story behind its creation. 
            I sought to reproduce and maintain the features that stand out in Jannon's typeface, such as the 
            drop-shaped terminal and the slightly inclined axis.

            Caroline is a Brazilian designer who graduated in 2022 in Graphic Design at UFPR. 
            Since she had her first contact with type design at university, she became very 
            interested in the subject. She is currently in the type west program to further delve 
            and combine with other areas she is interested in such as research and accessibility.
