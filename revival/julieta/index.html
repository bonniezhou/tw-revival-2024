            The Binney & Ronaldson foundry was one of the first type foundries in America. 
            It was founded in Philadelphia in 1796 by Archibald Binney and James Ronaldson. The company 
            specialized in the production of high-quality type and was known for its attention to detail.

          <p>
            The Binney & Ronaldson Specimen included a wide variety of typefaces, from serifs and sans serifs 
            to ornaments and decorative designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book was designed to show the full range of foundry skill and to help printers select the 
            right types for their projects.
