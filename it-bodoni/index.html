        <h1>IT Bodoni</h1>
        <h2>Mariya Lish</h2>
        <p>
          IT Bodoni is a revival of the famous Bodoni typeface, named after its creator, Giambattista Bodoni, an Italian typographer,
          printer, and type designer. Developed in the late 18th century, the Bodoni typeface is renowned for its elegance, modernity, and
          distinctive style, securing its place as a classic in typography.
          <br/><br/>
          One of the most striking features of Bodoni is its high contrast between thick and thin strokes, which gives the typeface a
          refined and sophisticated look. As a neoclassical typeface, Bodoni emerged during the Enlightenment period, an era that
          emphasised clarity, rationality, and simplicity. These qualities are beautifully reflected in Bodoni's design.
