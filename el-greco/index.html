        <h1>El Greco</h1>
        <h2>Rachel Ross</h2>
        <p>
          El Greco was a typeface designed by the Richard Gans Foundry operating from 1888-1975. The font was named after Greek
          painter, sculptor, and architect, El Greco (Dominikos Theotokopoulos, 1541-1614). El Greco immigrated to Toledo, Spain
          in 1577. He is one of the most well-known artists of the Spanish Renaissance due to his fantastic use of color and
          distorted compositions. When looking at El Greco’s paintings next to the typeface, they pair well together. Both display
          skill in their craft as well as embracing imperfection and slight distortion.
          <br/><br/>
          While developing the revival, I couldn’t help but think that it also embodies the spirit of a Hobbit. It’s short,
          friendly, and has wide feet, or in this case, serifs. As Tolkein describes, “They dress in bright colours, favouring
          yellow and green. They are usually shy but are nevertheless capable of great courage and amazing feats under the proper
          circumstances.”
