          <h1>Charlotte</h1>
          <h2>Adriana Garcidueñas</h2>
          <p>
            The source material comes from the first edition of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë. 
            The typeface used to print this book is a Modern Roman from the 19th century. 
            The main characteristic of this typeface is its high contrast and wide uppercase and prominent ball terminals.
            The reason I chose this source is because Jane Eyre is my favorite book, but the real inspiration came when I discovered that the typeface used to print this book was a scotch roman with just a number for name and commonly used with no distinction or glory, just an another typeface from the box, it made me want to give this lovely typeface its own voice in this modern world. 
            Is the original letter rounded? Or is it just ink bleed?
            The finding of sharp and angular corners led me to believe that is the normal expansion of the ink in the cheap or low quality in which this book was printed on.
            After quite time searching for each letter and analyzing them, I realized that this print has a lot of ink bleed.
            So, I took the decision to make a Modern Roman with geometric serifs.
