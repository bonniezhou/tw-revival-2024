        <h2>Rajan Kumar Singh (Dashaen)</h2>
        <p>
          Rudo is a typeface inspired by Fairfield, an original typeface designed by Rudolf Ruzicka in the 1940s. As a calligrapher
          working on a revival project, I sought a metal typeface that evoked the same feeling I experience when viewing calligraphic
          letterforms. That’s when I discovered Fairfield.
          <br/><br/>
          Rudolf Ruzicka (1883–1978) was a Czech American designer, typographer, wood engraver, and illustrator. A friend of the
          renowned designer W.A. Dwiggins, Ruzicka was associated with Mergenthaler Linotype as a consultant for 50 years.

          Rajan Kumar Singh, also known as Dashaen, is a calligrapher and type designer based in Haryana, India. He has a passion for
          all kinds of letterforms and enjoys exploring various methods of creating them. When he’s not immersed in the world of letters,
          he spends his time listening to hip hop music.
