        <p>
          Tweedle is a revival typeface based on the scotch roman style type used found in a 1909
          edition of Lewis Carroll’s “Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There.”
          Throughout the term, I worked to make the type feel more evenly textured with less contrast for
          increased legibility. Proportions were adjusted for better spacing and texture in comparison to
          the original model, while some quirky design details were preserved in order to maintain the
          personality of the original type that speaks to the source and material’s essence.
          Tweedle is intended for text use and in applications that need a friendly, readable typeface that
          combines classic modernist sensibilities with playfulness.

          Rina is a multidisciplinary designer, artist, and educator originally from the Philippines and based in
          Washington, DC. She is the founder and creative director of Studio Aorta, a boutique creative agency
          producing exhibitions, print design, and illustrations, and an adjunct associate professor at the
          University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her extensive work with type in her projects for
          compelling visualizations led her to delve into type design. Prior to Type West, Rina graduated from the
          Type@Cooper 2023 Condensed program. Through Type West, she hopes to continue broadening her
          type design skills and deepen her knowledge of type, further enriching her art and design practice.
