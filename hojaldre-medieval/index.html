        <h1>Hojaldre Medieval</h1>
        <h2>Aitana Cantú</h2>
        <p>
          While searching through old books at my grandparents house in Spain, I found the source for what became
          Hojaldre Medieval. Printed in 1940, “Cultura Religiosa: Dogma, La Moral, La Gracia” was a religion textbook
          my grandma had to read when she was 13. I was hesitant at first to pursue this typeface because the book was printed during the height of Franco’s
          dictatorship and is about religious obedience. But when I continued my research, it turned out that the type
          designer, Sjoerd Hendrik de Roos (1877-1962), was a staunch supporter of the first socialist in the Dutch
          parliament.

          Hollandsche Mediæval was made in 1912 by S. H. de Roos at the Amsterdam Type Foundry. It was the first
          Dutch-made typeface for 150 years and considered the first modern typeface in the Netherlands.
